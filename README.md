# PLC_Project

## Overview
This project aims to create a game centered around the Pokédex, a text-based system to store and display Pokémon data. Players will be able to go on adventures to discover new Pokémon that they can add to their collection.

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have `gcc` installed.
- Make sure `make` is installed on your system.

## Compilation
To compile the program, run:
```sh
make
```
This will compile the `main.c` file located in the `src/` directory and generate an executable named `program`

## Clean Up
To remove the compiled executable, run:
```sh
make clean
```
This will delete the `program` file

## File Structure
```css
